#### FAQ

* Why launcher?
I'm launching unity at low resolution with borders removed to make it look like a software splash screen haha.
This can also be done inside unity itself, at the time for me this was just quicker to do.

* Why separate config software?
Wanted to avoid input hooks, at the time this was just quicker for me to do than ipc or dll.
